# The legacy
Starting late 2011 I decided to start a website surrounding my wife's wonderful catechisms, wisdom, and insights into the world. All the posts here are authentic and curated in the sense that they were actually said and are presented unaltered.

## *keep in mind, however...*
...the majority of content here is taken *completely* out of context. That's sort of the point. She gets frustrated easily and blurts out things that she may not have meant to, even things that she vehemently disagrees with in hindsight.

## Author's note:
No matter how ridiculous the content is here, this site nor any of its sayings are meant to condone racism, racial prejudice, hatred, bigotry, phobia, or any of the dreadful things associated with the very person for whose sudden and unnecessary ownership of twitter.com caused these tweets to be taken down. If you arrived here by a funny tweet that appears to uphold these ideals, please learn and grow as a person.
